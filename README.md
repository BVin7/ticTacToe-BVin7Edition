<h1>Tic Tac Toe! - BVin7 Edition</h1>
</div>

> This is my first attempt at creating a tic-tac-toe game with Javascript! Enjoy!!!

#### Features
- Basic rules of a normal tic-tac-toe game that you already know and love
- You can choose a name for you and your opponent and start playing right away
- The game won't start if you don't name BOTH players. Do it
- Every time you win a match, one point will be added to your score, as will be to your opponent's if they win
- If the match ends with a draw, no points are given to the players
- After a match ends (whether it's through a draw or a player's victory), you will have the choice to play another match with the same score and players or change players and start it all over again
